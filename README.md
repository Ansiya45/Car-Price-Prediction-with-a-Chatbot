This project combines machine learning and an interactive chatbot to predict and explore car prices.
It has two main components:

1. Car Price Prediction Model:
Built using Python and machine learning libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn).
Trained on a dataset containing car attributes such as name, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, owner type, and selling price.
Predicts the selling price of a car based on user-provided input.

2. Car Information Chatbot:
A rule-based chatbot designed to answer natural language queries about cars in the dataset.
Users can ask questions such as:
"Which car has the highest selling price?",
"Show me cars produced after 2015.",
"Which petrol automatic car has the lowest kilometers driven?"
Provides formatted, user-friendly responses.
